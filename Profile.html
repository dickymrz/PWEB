<p> Hello guys!! </p>
<p>
My name is Dicky Maulana Rozi, and my friends call me Dikki. I am a student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. I was born in Surabaya, March 25th 1999.
</p>
<p>
My favorite food is Sushi, while my favorite drink is Nutriboost. About the hobby,I really like reading, I really like writting but I really like to play basketball, and I really like to play the game. 
</p>
If there is a competition, I would love to take part as long as it relates to the world of authorship. It was my first step to achieve my goal of becoming a famous writer like Raditya Dika or J.K Rowling. 
</p>
<p>
Yep, thatâ€™s all that I can tell about myself. So, if among my friends who also like to reading my content, go check out my content. Thank you.
